# PROG8110 - Assignment 1

This is a twilio chatbot adventure game for Conestoga's College Computer Applications Development program, course PROG8110.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Deployment

Cloning the Repository

If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than PROG8110, you can specify the new directory name as the additional argument:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bernardojunqueira/prog8110-assignment1.git PROG8110
```

Install the Packages

This command installs the project packages, and any packages that it depends on.

```
$ npm install
```

Start the Project (node server.js)

This runs an arbitrary command specified in the packageâ€™s "start" property of its "scripts" object. If no "start" property is specified on the "scripts" object, it will run node server.js.

```
$ npm start
```
